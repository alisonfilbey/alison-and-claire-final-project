# Pedestrian Safety on Chicago Roads
Examining how speed limit, pedestrian action, driver action, and crash location are correlated with traffic crashes causing severe or fatal pedestrian injuries in the city of Chicago.

**Team members: Alison Filbey and Claire Conzelmann**

## Overview:
This project is motivated by the recent rise in pedestrian traffic related fatalities and the proposed legislation in Illinois to lower the statutory speed limit in urban areas from 30 mph to 25 mph. We use data on traffic crashes in the city of Chicago to examine potential impacts on severe pedestrian involved traffic crashes should this legislation be passed and explore other avenues for policy intervention aimed at preventing pedestrian fatalities.
