# Pedestrian Safety on Chicago Roads
Examining how speed limit, pedestrian action, driver action, and crash location are correlated with traffic crashes causing severe or fatal pedestrian injuries in the city of Chicago.

**Team members: Alison Filbey and Claire Conzelmann**

## Overview:
This project is motivated by the recent rise in pedestrian traffic related fatalities and the proposed legislation in Illinois to lower the statutory speed limit in urban areas from 30 mph to 25 mph. We use data on traffic crashes in the city of Chicago to examine potential impacts on severe pedestrian involved traffic crashes should this legislation be passed and explore other avenues for policy intervention aimed at preventing pedestrian fatalities.

## Read our Report:
For more information on our data sources, methods, results, and policy implications, read our final report located at ...**/writeup.pdf**. An html version of our writeup can be recreated by knitting ...**/writeup.qmd**.

## Run our Code:
To replicate our findings, we recommend knitting our ...**/writeup.qmd**, which calls and runs our code files to produce our results. You can also replicate our results without knitting our report by running the code located in this repository in the following order:
1. ...**Code/data_cleaning.py**
2. ...**Code/plots.py**

## Run our App:
After knitting our ...**/writeup.qmd** or after running ...**Code/data_cleaning.py**, load our shiny app located at ...**shiny-app/app.py** to view our dashboard that displays the locations of severe pedestrian crashes throughout Chicago neighborhoods.
